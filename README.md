# evaluator.js

*Evaluator* is a JavaScript library that implements an equations evaluator in HTML pages. It can be used to quickly implement calculators in HTML pages.

The focus of the module is a shift from coding to configuration: JavaScript-variables are *bound* to object members and HTML element attributes, input element changes cause a function list to be executed.

What remains for the user is to implement the functions to be called.
